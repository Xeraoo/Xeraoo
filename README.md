Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a second-cycle student at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, focusing on **Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in **Python programming** and geospatial analysis. I’m passionate about leveraging **satellite imagery, spatial data, and GIS tools** to solve complex environmental and urban challenges.

### 🛠 Skills and Expertise:
- **Remote Sensing & GIS**: Expertise in tools like **Google Earth Engine, QGIS, ArcGIS**, and **ESA SNAP** for satellite data analysis.
- **Python**: Data analysis, geospatial processing, and automation.
- **SQL**: Designing and managing relational databases, spatial databases, and complex queries.

Beyond my professional expertise, I have a keen interest in **ludology**, the study of video games, exploring their structure and the unique insights they provide into storytelling and interactive design. I also enjoy delving into **art** and creativity.



Feel free to explore my repositories, and let’s connect if you share an interest in GIS, remote sensing, or any of my other passions!
